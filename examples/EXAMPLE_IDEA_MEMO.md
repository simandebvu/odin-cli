# Idea Memo: Developer Productivity Dashboard

> **Generated by `gh odin ideate`**

## One-liner
A real-time dashboard that aggregates code metrics, PR status, and deployment health for development teams.

## User & Pain
**User**: Engineering managers and tech leads at startups (5-50 person teams)

**Pain**: Context-switching between GitHub, CI/CD tools, and monitoring dashboards to understand team velocity and blockers

**Trigger**: Daily standup prep, sprint planning, when executives ask "how are we doing?"

## Alternatives & Wedge
**Current alternatives**: Manual aggregation via GitHub insights + Datadog + Slack threads. Some teams use Linear or Jira dashboards but they don't integrate deployment health.

**Our wedge**: Single pane of glass with real-time updates. GitHub CLI native (no API tokens to manage). Works in terminal OR web.

## MVP Scope
**Included**:
- GitHub PR metrics (open/merged/review time)
- Basic deployment health (last deploy, failure rate)
- Team velocity chart (last 30 days)
- Terminal UI (blessed/ink) + web export

**Explicitly NOT included**:
- Jira/Linear integration (GitHub only for MVP)
- Predictive analytics
- Custom metric definitions
- Multi-org support

**Proof test**: Demo to 3 engineering teams, get feedback on whether they'd use it daily

## Risks
- **Distribution** (how to reach teams?)
- **Trust** (convincing them to authorize GitHub access)

## Competition
- **GitHub Insights** - Built-in but limited, no deployment health
- **LinearB** - Enterprise, expensive, complex setup
- **DevDynamics** - Similar but SaaS-only, not CLI-native

**Our differentiation**: Terminal-native, GitHub CLI extension (zero setup), combines code + deploy metrics

## Analysis (Copilot)

**Scores**:
- Clarity: 8/10
- Differentiation: 7/10
- Feasibility: 8/10

**Recommendation**: ✅ **SHIP**

This is a well-defined problem with a clear user segment. The wedge (GitHub CLI native + terminal UI) is defensible. Main risk is distribution, but the GitHub CLI extension ecosystem provides a built-in channel.

**Top risks & experiments**:
1. **Distribution risk** → Experiment: Post to r/devtools, HN Show HN, and GitHub's official extension showcase
2. **Trust risk** → Experiment: Start with read-only metrics, clearly document what data is accessed

**One-line pitch**:
> Terminal-native dev team dashboard that aggregates GitHub + deployments in one view
