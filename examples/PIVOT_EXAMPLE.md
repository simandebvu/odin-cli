# Idea Memo: Social Network for Developers

> **Example of PIVOT recommendation (Kill Switch Mode)**

## One-liner
A social network where developers can share code snippets and discuss technical topics

## User & Pain
**User**: Developers
**Pain**: Twitter is too noisy, Reddit is too anonymous
**Trigger**: When they want to discuss code publicly

## Alternatives & Wedge
**Current alternatives**: Twitter, Reddit, Dev.to, Hashnode
**Our wedge**: Better for technical discussions

## MVP Scope
**Included**: Profiles, posts, code snippets, comments
**Explicitly NOT included**: DMs, groups, jobs board
**Proof test**: Get 100 developers to post weekly

## Risks
- Distribution
- Feasibility

## Analysis (Kill Switch Mode)

**Scores**:
- Clarity: 6/10
- Differentiation: 4/10
- Feasibility: 7/10

⚠️ **Recommendation: PIVOT**

### Why This Needs Work

No clear differentiation. Every competitor can copy your approach.

**The Fatal Flaw:** Missing unfair advantage. 'Better UX' or 'easier to use' aren't wedges.

### Consider Instead

1. Find a specific niche with unique needs (e.g., 'for X industry')
2. Identify a technical advantage (e.g., proprietary data, network effects)
3. Target underserved segment competitors ignore

### Top Risks

**Network effects**
→ Experiment: Why would developers leave Twitter/Reddit where the audience already is?

**Distribution**
→ Experiment: How will you reach critical mass (10,000+ active users)?

### One-Line Pitch
> Manual pitch crafting needed after pivot

## Next Steps
⚠️ **REFINE:** Address the issues above, then run ideation again
