🛑 **Recommendation: PARK**

### Why You Should Not Build This

This is a feature, not a product.

**The Fatal Flaw:** Saturated market with low differentiation. You'll burn time and money competing with giants.

### Consider Instead

1. Niche down dramatically (e.g., 'todo list for ADHD developers')
2. Bundle this as a feature in a larger product
3. Find an adjacent problem with less competition

### Top Risks

**Distribution**
→ Experiment: Even if you build it, no one will find it in a sea of 10,000+ todo apps

**Differentiation**
→ Experiment: "Simpler and more beautiful" can be copied in 2 weeks by any competitor

## Next Steps
🛑 **STOP:** Park this idea. Try one of the alternatives above instead.
