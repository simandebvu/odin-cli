## 🛑 Kill Switch Mode (Brutally Honest)

**The Problem:** Most founders waste months building products no one wants.

**Odin's Solution:** Kill Switch Mode applies strict validation rules before you write any code.

### How It Works

Odin analyzes your idea with **harsh criteria**:
- **Clarity:** Is the problem and solution crystal clear?
- **Differentiation:** Is there a genuine unfair advantage? (not just "better UX")
- **Feasibility:** Can a small team actually build and ship this?

### Recommendation Thresholds

- ✅ **SHIP:** All scores >= 7, clear wedge, specific user
- ⚠️ **PIVOT:** Scores 5-6, idea has potential but needs refinement
- 🛑 **PARK:** Any score < 5, OR saturated market, OR "nice to have" problem

### Examples

**PARK Example:**
```
💡 Idea: "A simple, beautiful todo list app"
🛑 Recommendation: PARK

Why: This is a feature, not a product. Saturated market with
10,000+ competitors. "Simpler and more beautiful" can be copied
in 2 weeks.

Consider instead:
1. Niche down: "Todo list for ADHD developers"
2. Bundle as feature in existing product
3. Solve adjacent, less crowded problem
```

**SHIP Example:**
```
💡 Idea: "GitHub CLI for validated execution plans"
✅ Recommendation: SHIP

Scores: Clarity 8/10, Differentiation 8/10, Feasibility 9/10

Why: Clear problem, strong wedge (GitHub-native), specific user.
Build this.
```

### What Makes This Unique

**Most tools say "yes" to everything.** They'll generate issues for any idea, no matter how weak.

**Odin says "no" to bad ideas.** It saves you from wasting months on products that won't work.

**The Kill Switch catches:**
- Generic problems with no wedge
- Vague user definitions ("everyone")
- Saturated markets with weak differentiation
- Features masquerading as products
- "Nice to have" problems (vitamins, not painkillers)
